# GameForTheGirls

I wanted to create a simple version of tetris 
that I can build on as I improve my skills in 
javaScript. This is a tutorial I followed.
It's a good start, I will add some more 
style and sound possibly, as I learn 
how to.
It's a game that my daughters love and I wanted
to share with them.
I think they'll be excited to see this.
